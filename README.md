## Vital Signs - Climate
temperature data line graph - 08/2010

### Description
* This graph provides a temperature data reading for one sensor over a series of readings in August 2010
* The data is available in as a csv (located in the `data/climate_data` folder).


### Next steps
Visualizations for these data might fall into two categories, the second of which is visualized here.
* Cat-1: Maps to illustrate where the sensors fall and show correlation to other mapped data
* Cat-2: Graph to illustrate the values collected by sensors at the subplot points

### Demo
You can find the work in progress demo [here](http://auremoser.github.io/VitalSigns-climate/).

It should look something like this:
